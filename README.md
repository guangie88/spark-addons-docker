# `spark-addons-docker`

Dockerfile setup with GS and S3 JARs add-ons to
[`spark`](https://github.com/guangie88/spark-docker).

If this is set up as a Spark slave, then it would be able to read directly from
both Google Storage (GS) bucket or AWS S3 bucket.

This builds for both slimmed Debian and Alpine.
